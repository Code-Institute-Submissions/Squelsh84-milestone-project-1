# Maide Connemara

 My First Milestone Project for Code Institute is a website idea for a real business. My father has been making Handcrafted walking sticks for years but has only ever given them away for free or people have bought them when calling to the house. 
This is a fully responsive website designed to create a funnel to create first contact with potential customers.

# UX
 The aim of th design was to create a first contact with potential customers using a simple scroll down design. 
This website is targeted towards customers who are enthusiastic about hiking, trekking and trail walking.
### Wireframe

## Features

#### Feature 1 – Scroll spy Navigation Bar
The navigation bar changes colour as you scroll down the page. This allows the user to know easily where they are on the page.
This collapses into a 'burger icon' dropdown menu in mobile screen sizes to reduce over-crowding and improve user experience.

#### Feature 2 – Jumbotron with Find out more button
This feature brings the potential customer to the embedded video to find out more about the sticks and how they’re made.

#### Feature 3 – Cards with Images
Gives the customer a brief description of types of woods used with buttons to more information.

#### Feature 4 – Embedded Video
Lets the person feel that they know who the are dealing with and helps create a bond with the customer.

#### Feature 5 – Gallery with Fancybox viewer
Customers can see how previous pieces of work have turned out and when clicked can get a closer look at the craftsman work.

#### Feature 6 – Contact Form
Allows potential customers to ask questions about pieces in the gallery or to start the process of ordering a piece.

#### Feature 7 – Social media icons in footer
Allows the customer to connect and follow the craftsman’s other pages.



### Features Left to Implement
- Add a payment feature for sticks available.
- A map of forests for best walks
- Create a blog section to share information about the art of Stick making and some walks around Ireland.
- GDPR compliant pop-up screen to make sure the website complies with European law.


## Testing 
- Used Google Chrome developer tools to test website responsiveness across multiple devies such as Tablets and Mobiles.
- Tested the contact form for the required attribute. With this attribute it will not let you submit the form with the required information.
- tested that the smooth scroll worked when clicking on the links in the Navbar.
- Tested the link buttons to esure the responded correctly.
- Used [W3c validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate both HTML and CSS.
- Used [Browserling](https://www.browserling.com/) to test the website across multiple browsers.

### Issues when Testing
- On certain screen sizes the padding on the sides of the about us section were creating a long text. I reduced the padding to creae a larger area.
- The navbar menu was taking up to much screen space on the iPad. To fix this I changed it to become a 'hamburger menu' from lg down.
- The type of woods cards were leaking over into the next container.
