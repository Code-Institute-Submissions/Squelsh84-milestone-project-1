# Maide Connemara

 My First Milestone Project for Code Institute is a website idea for a real business. My father has been making Handcrafted walking sticks for years but has only ever given them away for free or people have bought them when calling to the house. 
This is a fully responsive website designed to create a funnel to create first contact with potential customers.

# UX
 The aim of th design was to create a first contact with potential customers using a simple scroll down design. 
This website is targeted towards customers who are enthusiastic about hiking, trekking and trail walking.
### Wireframe
