# Maide Connemara

My First Milestone Project for Code Institute is a website idea for a real business. My father has been making Handcrafted walking sticks for years but has only ever given them away for free or people have bought them when calling to the house. 
This is a fully responsive website designed to create a funnel to create first contact with potential customers.

Please click [here](https://squelsh84.github.io/milestone_project_1/) for a live demo of the website. 

# UX
 
#### Who is the target audience?  
- A person who is interested in hiking.
- Uses Walking sticks for hiking or everyday walking.
- Looking for a unique piece that can't be bought in a store.

#### Why is this the best way to target the audience?
- The website is designed to lead the customer down through the page to create the initial contact. As the person makes their way down the page the learn about the person to build a rapor.
Next they learn about the types of wood used and a video of the workshop. Following this the see some sticks that have been made and the different types of woods used. This helps the potential customer to have an idea of what they want.
At the end they will be able to make contact through the simple contact form provided at the bottom.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to know where the material was sourced.
2. As a user, I want to know what wood is used.
3. As a user, I want to see previous work.
4. As a user, I want to be able to make contact easily.

## Features

#### Feature 1 – Scroll spy Navigation Bar
The navigation bar changes colour as you scroll down the page. This allows the user to know easily where they are on the page.
This collapses into a 'burger icon' dropdown menu in mobile screen sizes to reduce over-crowding and improve user experience.

This feature brings the potential customer to the embedded video to find out more about the sticks and how they’re made.

#### Feature 3 – Cards with Images
Gives the customer a brief description of types of woods used with buttons to more information.

#### Feature 4 – Embedded Video
Lets the person feel that they know who the are dealing with and helps create a bond with the customer.

#### Feature 5 – Gallery with Fancybox viewer
Customers can see how previous pieces of work have turned out and when clicked can get a closer look at the craftsman work.

#### Feature 6 – Contact Form
Allows potential customers to ask questions about pieces in the gallery or to start the process of ordering a piece.

#### Feature 7 – Social media icons in footer
Allows the customer to connect and follow the craftsman’s other pages.



### Features Left to Implement
- Add a payment feature for sticks available.
- A map of forests for best walks
- Create a blog section to share information about the art of Stick making and some walks around Ireland.
- GDPR compliant pop-up screen to make sure the website complies with European law.


## Testing 
- Used Google Chrome developer tools to test website responsiveness across multiple devies such as Tablets and Mobiles.
- Tested the contact form for the required attribute. With this attribute it will not let you submit the form with the required information.
- tested that the smooth scroll worked when clicking on the links in the Navbar.
- Tested the link buttons to esure the responded correctly.
- Used [W3c validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate both HTML and CSS.
- Used [Browserling](https://www.browserling.com/) to test the website across multiple browsers.

### Issues when Testing
- On certain screen sizes the padding on the sides of the about us section were creating a long text. I reduced the padding to creae a larger area.
- The navbar menu was taking up to much screen space on the iPad. To fix this I changed it to become a 'hamburger menu' from lg down.
- The type of woods cards were leaking over into the next container. 
- When testing on different browser I found the code had not been optimised and used [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to optimize it.
